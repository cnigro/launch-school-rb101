# Write a method that takes a string, and returns a new string in which every
# consonant character is doubled. Vowels (a,e,i,o,u), digits, punctuation, and
# whitespace should not be doubled.

  doubled = ''
  text.each_char do |char|
    doubled << char
    doubled << char unless char.match(/[0-9aeiouAEIOU\W]/)
  end
  doubled

# Examples:
p double_consonants('String') == "SSttrrinngg"
p double_consonants("Hello-World!") == "HHellllo-WWorrlldd!"
p double_consonants("July 4th") == "JJullyy 4tthh"
p double_consonants('') == ""
