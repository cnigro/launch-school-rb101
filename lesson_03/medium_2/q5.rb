# Depending on a method to modify its arguments can be tricky:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
# Whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted "depends"
# upon what is going on inside the method.

# How can we refactor this practice problem to make the result easier to
# predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?
